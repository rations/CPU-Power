"""Emit src/platform/appicon.h from raw RGBA dumps of the icon ladder.

Called only by scripts/make-icons.sh, which supplies MASTER_SHA, EMBED and TMP in the
environment and the output path as argv[1]. Split out of that script rather than inlined so that
the shell stays readable and this stays greppable.

The output is the _NET_WM_ICON payload, already in the property's own byte layout: for each
image, width, height, then width*height packed ARGB cardinals, rows left to right and top to
bottom (EWMH 1.5 section 5.12). Images are simply concatenated.

Input is straight, NON-premultiplied RGBA -- which is what the property wants and what
ImageMagick's RGBA: output gives. Cairo's ARGB32 is premultiplied and would be wrong here.

// THE PIXELS ARE NOT PREMULTIPLIED -- unlike every other surface in this program, which is Cairo
// ARGB32 and is. The specification is silent on the point, so it was measured against a running
// client rather than assumed: a 128x128 icon published by VLC held 252 pixels whose colour
// exceeded their own alpha, which premultiplied data cannot contain, and its semi-transparent
// pixels matched the source PNG's values exactly. Anything that ever routes this artwork through
// a Cairo surface must un-premultiply on the way back out.
