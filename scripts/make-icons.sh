# Regenerate the installable icon set from the single master artwork.
#
# Everything under packaging/icons/ is DERIVED. The master is icon.png at the top of the tree,
# and this script is the only thing that should ever write the derived files, so that a question
# about any one of them ("why is the 16px one sharpened?") has an answer in one place rather than
# in whatever command happened to be typed that day.
#
# It produces TWO things, for the two entirely separate ways a Linux desktop finds an icon:
#
#   packaging/icons/hicolor/<size>x<size>/apps/cpu-power.png
#       The icon theme. Found by NAME, without an extension, from the desktop entry's Icon= key,
#       following the freedesktop.org Icon Theme Specification. This is what a menu, a dock or an
#       application grid reads.
#
#   src/platform/appicon.h
#       The same artwork as a C++ array, published on the window itself as _NET_WM_ICON. This is
#       what a PLAIN WINDOW MANAGER reads -- it never looks at desktop entries at all, so without
#       this the titlebar and task list of the tool's actual target audience stay blank.
#
# The generated header is committed, not built, so that compiling this project needs a compiler
# and not an image toolchain.
#
# Usage:  scripts/make-icons.sh [master.png]
#
# Needs ImageMagick and python3. Writes only inside packaging/icons/ and src/platform/appicon.h.
# Touches nothing installed.

# The same artwork again, as _NET_WM_ICON data compiled into the GUI.
#
# EWMH 1.5 section 5.12: "This is an array of 32bit packed CARDINAL ARGB with high byte being A,
# low byte being B. The first two cardinals are width, height. Data is in rows, left to right and
# top to bottom." Several images are concatenated, each preceded by its own width and height.
#
# THE PIXELS ARE NOT PREMULTIPLIED. The specification does not say so either way, which is the
# trap, because Cairo's ARGB32 -- what the rest of this program draws in -- is premultiplied. It
# was measured rather than assumed, by comparing a running client's published property against
# the artwork it was built from. ImageMagick's RGBA output is straight, non-premultiplied, so
# this pipeline needs no conversion -- but it needs to stay that way, hence the comment.
#
# Only the small end of the ladder is embedded. _NET_WM_ICON is read for titlebars, task lists,
# pagers and window switchers, which want 16 to 64 pixels; the big sizes are what the icon theme
# is for, and a window manager MAY scale. Embedding 128 alone would nearly triple this file for
# the case least likely to read it.
